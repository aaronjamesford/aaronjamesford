## What I'm working on

Nothing right now!

## Fun fact about me

When I'm not being an absolute recluse I can usually be found in fields, among trees or near abandoned buildings flying my FPV freestyle drone.

## Skills

## Professional Experience

### [Lodgify](https://lodgify.com) (Oct 2018 - Jul 2022)
Backend Tech Lead for Activation team

Working on the team that maintains the CMS for vacation rentals and the website builder. We were also responsible for developing new features to help increase user activation through improving features and UX of the user's initial interactions and by supporting the frontend developers in the team so that the necessary features can be delivered.

The company also had a monolith that is in the process of being migrated to a microservices architecture in kubernetes. As a team we would have to decide if some changes in there were worth making or whether it was time to revist and migrate out.

As part of the tech lead role I was responsible for code quality, architecture and design within the team as well as onboarding new members. All BE tech leads took part in larger decision making processes that would affect all BE teams in the company in the push for technical excellence.

### [Esendex](https://esendex.co.uk) (Nov 2014 - Sept 2018)
Software Developer in the Core SMS Platform team

During my time at Esendex I was primarily working on the team that maintained and built new components for the platform and APIs used to send over 4 million SMS messages per day. The projects ranged from brute force attack prevention to creating a new scheduling component so that customers can reliably expect a message to be sent at a specific time. As new team members arrived I was responsible for mentoring and teaching them the practices, introducing them to the codebase and any significant quirks as well as teaching them about the SMS domain.

### [Redbox Recorders](https://www.redboxvoice.com/) (Jun 2013 - Nov 2014)
Junior Software Developer in the Connectivity team

Working closely within an agile team of eight people that creates and maintains the recording platform at RedBox. We worked mainly with C# and C++, and sometimes dabbling into Python, in a Windows environment. The projects range from  improvements or extensions to existing recording integrations, creating new components or recording integrations, and maintenance of the system.
